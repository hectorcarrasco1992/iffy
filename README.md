Super Car 

### The Super Toxic SuperCar App

The Super Toxic SuperCar Ap will tell you whether your car is a "SuperCar" in a sarcastic and judgemental way. It can also judge if your car us fast or not in an elitist fashion.

### Example 
function horsePowerToWeight(horsePower,weight){
    let hpw = horsePower/weight

    return hpw >= 1 ? "You own a SuperCar" :"Your car is not that special";
}

### The Setup
    1. Fork the repo and clone in terminal
    2. make sure you are running node
    3. type node superCar.js (car Horsepower)(Car weight) (car top Speed)
    4. you will receive feed back based on these variables.
